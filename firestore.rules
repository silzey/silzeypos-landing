/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user data and a public-read, owner-write model for blog posts.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user account information. Only the user can access their own document.
 * - /users/{userId}/projects/{projectId}: Stores client projects as a subcollection of a user. Only the user can access these projects.
 * - /users/{userId}/invoices/{invoiceId}: Stores billing invoices as a subcollection of a user. Only the user can access these invoices.
 * - /blog_posts/{blogPostId}: Stores blog posts. Any user can read, but only the author can create, update, or delete.
 * - /demo_requests/{demoRequestId}: Stores demo requests. No specific authorization is defined, defaulting to no access.
 * - /donations/{donationId}: Stores user donations. No specific authorization is defined, defaulting to no access.
 * - /notifications/{notificationId}: Stores notifications sent to users. Only the recipient can read them.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is explicitly denied for the `/users` collection.
 * - The `authorId` field in `/blog_posts` is used to enforce ownership for write operations.
 * - Unspecified collections (`demo_requests`, `donations`) are secured by default with no read or write access.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Blog posts use the `authorId` field to directly associate the post with a user, avoiding the need for additional `get()` calls to verify ownership.
 * - Notifications use `recipientId` to control read access.
